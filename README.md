# Backend Architecture & Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I am an AI-Native Developer specializing in Python backend engineering and automation. I build backend architectures, automate business workflows, and develop data processing systems that solve real business problems.

> **Note on Source Code:** The systems described below actively power my business, [Sneakerport.cz](https://sneakerport.cz). Because they contain business logic, custom pricing algorithms, and live integrations, the source code remains private. 
> 
> Instead of showing raw code, I have recorded demonstrations showing my work.

## 1. Multi-Vendor Consignment Backend
This system allows other resellers to upload their stock to my website and sell their sneakers through me. I receive a commission from each sale. I used to be a reseller myself, so I knew what the shortcomings of these systems were, and I dare say I've created one of the best. 

## 2. Market Intelligence Scraper & Product Automation
A suite of custom Python-based tools designed to handle the heavy lifting of pricing and data entry. Instead of manually checking, recalculating, and entering prices, downloading product images, adding sneakers to categories, or adding descriptions, scripts do it for me.

## 3. Custom ERP & Double-Entry Accounting System
An automated financial and fulfillment tracking system built from scratch to replace manual accounting, minimize human error, and track precise profitability. 

**Key Features:**
* The program pairs transactions, automatically stocks and dispatches sneakers after pairing with files from the courier. 
* It generates purchase contracts for individual sellers. 
* It allows you to upload invoices to double-entry accounting records. 
* I can do my year-end closing and get files ready for the tax office, along with other work simplifications.
